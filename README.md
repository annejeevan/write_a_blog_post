## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib etc.,
- The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2011 to 2018 to better understand:
> * What are the most popular areas in Santa Clara for rentals and when (weekends, days etc)?  
> * On which days (weekdays or on weekends) the demand is more?
> * Analyzing the reviews of the listings  
> * Whats factors contribute to the better rating?

## 3. File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>  
- calendar.csv: Provides date, availability, and price data for each listing
- listings.csv: Provides comprehensive details about each listing including host details, location -  description and details, and review ratings
- reviews.csv: Provides details of review comments

To walk-thru the full project, check out the [notebook](DSND_1.ipynb).
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
